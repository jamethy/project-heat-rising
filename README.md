# Project Rising Heat

My house is two floors with a single forced air AC unit, and since the thermostat is downstairs, it's naturally hotter
upstairs. But how much?!

## Thermostat Data

I've got a Carrier thermostat, which doesn't have an API, so I just copied what
their [web app](https://www.carrier.com/residential/en/us/for-owners/controller-remote-access/) does.
