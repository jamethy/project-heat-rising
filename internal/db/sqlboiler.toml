# - First execut the migrations, either through the app or goose directly
# - to clean before executing:
#   $ rm $(grep -l "Code generated by SQLBoiler" internal/db/*.go)
#
# - to run:
#   $ sqlboiler -c internal/db/sqlboiler.toml --no-rows-affected --no-tests -o internal/db -p db psql
#
# This is typically run against a local development database, so these values should
# likely match what's in postgres.yml
